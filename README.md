PROJECT TITLE: CyberMed Healthcare Appointment System

#
PROJECT OVERVIEW
CyberMed is a Django-based healthcare appointment system, that enable Scheduling, 
and Booking of appointments between Doctors and Patients. The system handles user authentication
with custom roles for Doctor and Patients. Doctors are able to schedule appointments with patients,
while patients are able to book appointments with doctors. The application is structured such that 
there is no conflicing scheduling and booking time between the patient and doctors. Upon Scheduling
or Booking an appointment, the application indicated the appointment status, whether it be pending,
confirmed,completed or cancled.

#
PROJECT FEATURES
* User Authentication:JWT-based authentication using Django-based Rest Framework(DRF) with role-based access (Doctor or Partient).
* Role-Specific Behaviour: Users can update their profiles based on their roles.
* Management/Validation: Patients can book appointments with available doctors. Doctors can schedule appointments, with their patients.
The application doesn't allow for double booking or scheduling from either patients or doctors.
* RESTful API: The entire system is built using RESTful APIs for easy integration with front-end systems or mobile applicaions.
* User-Friendly: Automatically assigns the authenticated user's role(patients or doctors) without requiring the manual input of their ID.

* Tech Stack Backend: Django 5.1, Django Rest Framework (DRF) 
* Authentication: JWT (via djangorestframework-simplejwt) 
* Database: SQLite (can be swapped with PostgreSQL/MySQL) 
* Other Dependencies: Pillow (for image handling), django-use-email-as-username (for handling on-boarding process)
